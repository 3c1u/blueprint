@# Suggest

`Suggest` behaves similarly to [`Select`](#select/select-component), except it renders a
text input as the `Popover` target instead of arbitrary children.

<div class="@ns-callout @ns-intent-primary @ns-icon-info-sign">
    [Read the `Select` documentation](#select/select-component) for more advanced usage documentation.
</div>
